'''WALLET'''

'''Regular Wallet'''

Coinapult will allow you to create a Bitcoin wallet within its system solely by accessing its website and clicking in the link referencing the creation of a wallet. This wallet will not have any protection whatsoever and is given to you as a way to quickly set up a Bitcoin wallet and get a feel of Coinapult's Services.

BEFORE UPGRADING YOUR WALLET, THE WALLET AND ALL RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY COINAPULT ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. COINAPULT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY INFORMATION IS COMPLETE OR ACCURATE, THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR THAT ANY INFORMATION IS FREE OF VIRUSES AND/OR ROGUE OR MALICIOUS PROGRAMMING.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL COINAPULT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION USE OF OR RELIANCE ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICES, INTERRUPTIONS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, DELETIONS OF FILES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, NONDELIVERY OF INFORMATION, DISCLOSURE OF COMMUNICATIONS, OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE.

'''Upgraded Wallet'''

You may upgrade your wallet and associate an e-mail address and password to protect your Bitcoins. All other conditions indicated in these Terms shall apply to your Upgraded wallet.

'''Shared Wallet'''

Coinapult’s wallets are shared or commingled wallets. This means that Coinapult shall be free to take all necessary and appropriate measures to protect your Bitcoins within our system.

'''No “Pooling” of Funds'''

By accepting these Terms and by using our Services, you acknowledge that you must create a separate account for each one of your Customers and are forbidden to commingle your Customer's funds with your own or with any other Customer's funds. Furthermore, individual users are forbidden to share accounts. If account information is exposed and allowed to use by another person we reserve the right to suspend or cancel the Services. 

'''Exceptional Suspension of Services'''

Coinapult reserves the right to temporarily halt your ability of accessing your Bitcoin wallet due to technical difficulties or market liquidity issues. By accepting these Terms and by using our Services, you hereby waive all claims and damages arising out the inability to access your wallet for the duration of the technical difficulties.

'''LOCKS'''

Locks is an advanced wallet service that allows you to “lock” the value of your bitcoins for the value of an underlying asset or currency offered by our system at any given moment by providing the right for you to receive a certain amount of bitcoins at a future date that corresponds to the value of the underlying asset or currency chosen.

'''Locking your Bitcoins'''

You may choose to “lock” a certain amount of bitcoins in accordance with these Terms (the “Fixed Bitcoins”). When you “lock” your bitcoins, you are converting your Fixed Bitcoins into the right to receive a future amount of bitcoins based upon a future offered rate. We do not offer exchange services, and you are only entitled to receive bitcoins from us as set forth in these Terms.

'''Locking Quote'''

Before “locking” your Fixed Bitcoins, you will obtain a quote of the locking value of the Fixed Bitcoins corresponding to the value assigned by our system to an underlying asset or currency. Coinapult will communicate a time window to accept the quote for locking your Fixed Bitcoins into Variable Bitcoins.

'''Actual Locking'''

After having received a locking value for a certain amount of Fixed Bitcoins, you may accept the quote. After your acceptance of the quote described above, subject to these Terms, your Fixed Bitcoins will be converted into the right to receive a future amount of variable bitcoins corresponding to the quoted underlying asset or currency value (the “Variable Bitcoins”). By accepting the quote, you are further authorizing Coinapult to display a Variable Bitcoin balance in your wallet corresponding to the underlying asset value of your Fixed Bitcoins at the time of the lock.

'''Confirmations from the Bitcoin Network'''

After accepting the lock, the system will display a message indicating that your lock is being confirmed. Until such lock is confirmed, it is not a binding commitment. You will not be able to unlock your Variable Bitcoin balance until our system receives at least two confirmations from the Bitcoin network, and we accept and display a confirmation. NO ACCEPTED ORDER OR ANY PART THEREOF MAY BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELLED WITHOUT OUR PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT.

'''Locking Limits'''

Your ability to lock bitcoins is subject to limits we establish from time to time. You generally will be able to quote and lock a maximum of USD 3,000.00 worth of Fixed Bitcoins at a time. In addition, you will not generally be able to lock additional Bitcoin if such lock would cause you to exceed a maximum of USD 25,000.00 worth of Variable Bitcoins per underlying asset or currency. 

'''Unlocking Your Bitcoins'''

You can choose to “unlock” your Variable Bitcoins by following two consecutive steps: (1) obtaining a quote of the unlocking price offered by Coinapult, and (2) accepting the quote for unlocking your Variable Bitcoins. When you “unlock” your bitcoins, subject to these Terms, you will be entitled to receive bitcoins in your wallet based upon the offered rate. We do not offer exchange services, and you are only entitled to receive bitcoins from us as set forth in these Terms.

'''Unlocking Quote'''

Before “unlocking” your Variable Bitcoins, you must obtain a quote of the unlocking value of the Variable Bitcoins. Coinapult will communicate a time window to accept the quote for unlocking your Variable Bitcoins into Fixed Bitcoins. This quote is subject to the terms set forth in these Terms.

'''Actual Unlocking'''

After your acceptance of the quote described above, subject to these Terms, your Variable Bitcoins will be converted into a Fixed Bitcoin balance. By accepting the unlock, you are authorizing Coinapult to display the Fixed Bitcoin balance in your to your wallet, thus ending the lock. NO ACCEPTED ORDER OR ANY PART THEREOF MAY BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELLED WITHOUT OUR PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT.

'''Coinapult's Liquidity'''

Coinapult warrants that it, together with its suppliers, will at all times hold liquid assets equivalent to the fiat currency value of all confirmed Variable Bitcoins.

'''No Spending or Transfer of Variable Bitcoin'''

By accepting the current Terms and by using our Services, you acknowledge that you will not be able to spend your Variable Bitcoin balance while it is locked to a specific underlying asset or currency value. You hereby acknowledge that the system will not allow you to send or transfer in any way the Variable Bitcoin balance to any other Bitcoin address or person without unlocking your Variable Bitcoins first.

'''Exceptional Suspension of Services'''

Coinapult reserves the right to temporarily halt your ability of locking Fixed Bitcoin or unlocking Variable Bitcoin due to technical difficulties or market liquidity issues. By accepting these Terms and by using our Services, you hereby waive all claims and damages arising out the inability to lock your Fixed Bitcoin into Variable Bitcoins or unlock your Variable Bitcoins into Fixed Bitcoins for the duration of the technical difficulties or market liquidity issues.

'''COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS'''

'''Compliance with Applicable Laws'''

You represent that you are duly authorized to enter into these Terms and represent that with respect to your performance hereunder; you will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws. You will pay for all taxes of any nature arising with respect to the Services that apply in any jurisdiction. We are not responsible for determining whether our Services satisfy the local regulatory requirements of any jurisdiction. You will not use our Services unless lawful for you to do so.

'''Geographical Restrictions'''

Coinapult shall limit the geographical scope of these services from time to time. Coinapult will immediately terminate your account in case we detect that you have circumvented or attempted to circumvent Coinapult's geographical limitations to provide the Locks service.

'''TERMINATION'''

You are free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you're not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others' use of the Services. In the event of cancellation, termination or expiration of these Terms, the following terms and conditions will survive: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, LIMITED WARRANTY, INDEMNIFICATION, CONTROLLING LAW, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, and MISCELLANEOUS.

'''CONTROLLING LAW'''

These Terms will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Panama except for its conflicts of laws principles. Without limitation, the UN Convention for the International Sale of Goods will have no force or effect with respect to the Services.

'''DISPUTE RESOLUTION'''

You agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or arising out of these Terms or the Services will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section. Please read this Section carefully. It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.

'''Customer Service Conciliation'''

We will strive to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Coinapult, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting our customer service department. We shall work to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 calendar days of submission, you may bring a formal arbitration proceeding in accordance with this Section.

'''Arbitration'''

You agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration in accordance with the conditions set below.

'''Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate'''

IF YOU HAVE NOT USED THE SERVICES BEFORE, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE HEREIN ("OPT-OUT") BY DELIVERING TO US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE ("OPT-OUT NOTICE"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE DELIVERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NOTICE PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN THE MISCELLANEOUS SECTION BELOW. You will bee deemed not to “have used our services” if you have both (1) opened a wallet and have upgraded the wallet to obtain a username and password and (2) you have not deposited any bitcoins or made any transactions.

The Opt-Out Notice must include your name, address (including street address, city, state, country, and postal code). You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt-out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you opt-out of the requirement to arbitrate, all other parts of these terms including the other parts of the Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply to you. Opting out will have no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.

'''Arbitration Procedures'''

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply these Terms as a court would.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the requirement to arbitrate under these Terms is void or voidable.

The arbitration will be conducted by and shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules, as such Rules are modified by these Terms. The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions shall not apply. The ICC's rules are available at [http://www.iccwbo.org/ www.iccwbo.org]. 

The arbitration shall be held in Panama. However, if this forum is not convenient for you, you may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Panama without reference to its conflict-of-laws provisions, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Coinapult users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Coinapult user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity, except that the arbitrator will be subject to all the limitations set forth in these Terms, including that the arbitrator will not have the jurisdiction or power to award punitive damages, treble damages or any other damages which are not compensatory, even if permitted under the laws of the Republic of Panama. Any award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

'''No Class Actions.'''

YOU AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND COINAPULT AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER COINAPULT USERS.

'''Judicial Forum For Disputes'''

In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the courts of the Republic of Panama. You consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

'''MISCELLANEOUS'''

'''Entire Agreement; Severability'''

These Terms constitute the entire agreement with respect to the Services and/or these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements (whether oral or written), or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or by any administrative action (any such court or administrative action to be conducted in accordance with these Terms), such holding or action shall not negate the validity or enforceability of any other provisions hereof to the extent they are enforceable in the applicable jurisdiction. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights, except to Coinapult's affiliates, agents, representatives, suppliers and/or distributors.

'''Translation Discrepancies'''

Coinapult offers its Terms of Service in a wide range of languages for the recipient’s comfort of use. In case of discrepancy between the original English text and any translation, the original English text shall prevail.

All recipients are advised to carefully examine the original English text before acting upon a translation thereof. Any user who does not fully understand the original English text is strongly encouraged to contact Coinapult by e-mail at [mailto:legal@coinapult.com legal@coinapult.com].

'''Headings'''

The headings of each section in this agreement are included only for convenience and shall not affect the constructions of these Terms.

'''Assignment'''

You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Coinapult may freely assign its rights under this Agreement or with respect to the Services without notice to you.

'''Modifications'''

We may revise these Terms from time to time, by posting the most current version on our website. By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

'''Changes'''

We reserve the right at any time to make changes to our Services or other offerings without notice to you.

'''Force Majeure'''

We will not be deemed in default of these Terms to the extent that performance of its obligations or attempts to cure any breach are delayed or prevented by reason of any act of God, war, civil war, insurrections, bank failures, strikes, fires, floods, earthquakes, labor disputes, epidemics, governmental regulations, freight embargoes, natural disaster, act of government, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control.

'''Notices to Coinapult'''

All notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications to be given and received by Coinapult under these Terms shall be by email to [mailto:legal@coinapult.com legal@coinapult.com] and will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including any requirements that such notices be in writing and will be deemed to be given and received upon confirmation of receipt. 

'''Waiver and Conflict'''

The failure of Coinapult to exercise or enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not operate as a waiver. As it relates to the Services, if there is ever a conflict between these Terms and any other terms or policies these Terms will control.

'''If you have any questions about the Terms of Service please contact Coinapult at [mailto:legal@coinapult.com legal@coinapult.com] '''
